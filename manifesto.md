# COSMOS manifesto

Data is a major asset for all organizations, and this is particularly true in Official Statistics.

In Europe, the European strategy for data aims at creating a single market for data that will ensure global competitiveness and data sovereignty.

(add an example outside Europe)

Globally, the FAIR movement aims at making data easier to find and use.

Add reference to Open Science?

But realisation comes soon that data is unusable without metadata and that the FAIR principles actually boil down to requirements on metadata:
- interoperable and linked concepts
- standard description of data
- catalogues 

We need metadata that are:
- standard
- active
- FAIR

We propose to brand these "Smart Metadata"

The COSMOS conference is a place for the Official Statistics community to exchange on how to define, share, use and manage smart metadata.
