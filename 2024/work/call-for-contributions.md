# COSMOS 2024 - Call for Contributions

Insee is pleased to invite the statistical community to submit abstracts for presentations/posters at the first Conference On Smart Metadata for Official Statistics 2024 (Cosmos 2024), to be held 11-12 April in Paris, France (dates to be confirmed).

## Context

(add or replace with extract from manifesto)

Metadata standards useful for the statisticians have now arrived at maturity. Among others, we can mention W3C Data Cube, DCAT vocabularies and DDI-L standard (including XKOS extending SKOS for the representation of statistical classifications). A large amount of statistical metadata (concept schemes, thesauri, code lists, classifications, data structure definition) from international and national agencies has already been published on the web based on international standards (*add examples?*).

While implementing standards in our respective organisations is a continuous work, new emerging standards (VTL?...) and taking account the FAIR principles still offer new perspectives, new ideas, new innovations and new issues.

The idea of this conference is to set up a place where the statistical community can share experiences and tools and think ahead regarding the upcoming challenges about smart metadata.

Statistical community use more and more metadata standards for documenting and publishing their data. As a non-exhaustive list, let's mention: DDI, RDF (XKOS, SKOS, DCAT, Data cube, PROV-O...), SDMX, VTL, GSIM?...


## Conference Objectives

The COSMOS conference goals are to promote and illustrate the use of smart metadata, encompassing: standard, active, linked, FAIR, etc. 
The audience is metadata expert, official statiticians & stakeholders.

It will put emphasis on ways statistical organizations implement smart metadata in their institute focusing on tools/standards used, business use cases, best practices definition, governance, feedbacks (difficulties encountered, keys success) and so on. This is the first edition of this conference which we hope will be the beginning of a long series.


## Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but not limited to:

### Standard

- Any feedbacks about implementing standards in your organization?
- Any own ontologies created for supporting other needs?
- Any tools used or developed for supporting standards?
- Any best practices defined?
- Any interoperability issues between standards?
- How to reconcile the conceptual and implementation models?
- Have you defined core metadata for your organisation?
- How do you manage metadata (any burden issue?)?
- Governance?
- Sharing knowledge on a standards community
- Feedback: when do you decide to track changes (versioning)?
- How far should we go in terms of traceability? / How far do we version?

### Linked

- How can data and concepts be linked?
- Link with geospatial representation?
- What are the existing tools?
- How do we establish, document and share best practices?
- How can we perform data reconciliation, ontology matching and instance matching with statistical data?
- Link codes and concepts between institutes?
- Any experience about provenance implementation?

### Active metadata

The use of metadata can extend beyond their function of describing and helping to understand. Based on machine-actionnable semantically rich standard, metadata can automatically generate components of the statistical process. They take on a new role to some extent, no longer simply "information to facilitate understanding of statistics" but becoming "data used in the statistical business process"; hence the notion of active metadata.

Experiences of early or mature implementations are welcomed.

### FAIR

FAIR data are data which meet principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR) (Source: Wikipedia).
- How to assess the compliance with FAIR principles?
- How to implement FAIR principles in an organization?
- How transparent do we need to be knowing that we are not sharing confidential data?
- What does reusable mean based on statistical data?
- How provenance metadata help to be FAIRness?

## Submission guidelines

The submissions must be written in English using the Springer style (LNCS/CCIS one-column page format) and submitted non-anonymously in PDF via EasyChair. We invite the submission of original research results and proposed research directions related to the focus areas of the workshop, in one of the three categories given below:

- Full papers (up to 15 pages)
- Short papers (6-8 pages)
- Demos (up to 4 pages)

Please note that HTML+RDFa contributions are also welcome as long as the layout complies with the LNCS style.

All proposed papers must be submitted using the easychair conference management system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cosmos2024.

All submitted papers will be subject to peer-review process. At least one co-author of each accepted paper is required to register to COSMOS and present the paper.
